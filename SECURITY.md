# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

There will be no security ujpdates until I work out how they could apply.
the HTML circuit simulators are entirely self-contained; no code runs elsewhere.
The most likely vunerabilites are potential exploits, except the FPGA level is too far abstracted from the user level, to make any sense for this.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, or a concern of one, raise a comment in the Discussions.

Updates and discussions on a reported vulnerability are likely to be a low priority.
The vulnerability report will probably be declined as of concern, but may be accepted purely as a discussion.

Vulnerabilities in toolchains will be taken more seriously, when there are toolchains written.

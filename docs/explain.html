<H2 id="intro">Introduction</H2>

<H3>Current Status</H3>
<P>Okay, this is very much in a draft state at the moment:
<P>I have a mass/mess of notes on my original website... I tested my online
circuit simulations will work on GitHub pages, and then I created this structure
of contents, to fit things into. It may take a while.

<H3>A Proper Intro</H3>
<P>FPGA ^2, ie squared, means running a soft FPGA on a hard one. It's a
working title. There are several advantages, and I've learned a lot on the
journey.

<H2 id="what">What this is</H2>
<P>This is an open-source FPGA, not a design for putting on an FPGA...
Although it may also be temporarily that, during testing. It could also be a
simulation, HDL code, various diagrams &amp; descriptions, an ASIC, a
development board, or a stripboard with relays and LEDs for educational/test
purposes.
<P>An &quot;FPGA design&quot; usually refers to a design to be put on an
FPGA, rather than the design of the FPGA itself. This has been okay until
now, because somehow this appears to be the first open-source FPGA: And you
thought everything had already been invented. I've also had to write (and
rewrite) a lot of new software, and to set up strange new types of meet-up
events.

<H2 id="why">Why &amp; how this was developed</H2>
<P>Basically because I'm cheap. Or rather, I don't have so much money at the
moment. (&quot;The moment&quot;, being May 2023.) Things are very up and
down, at this time. So, I was looking at developing normal hardware designs
on Lattice-based dev boards, then I discovered my current Linux box can't run
the simulation software. This may be because I originally only bought it to
talk to a printer, and it was exactly the right cost/capability for that job,
ie doorstop level. But then the Windows&nbsp;7 end of service life wasn't
extended, and then Microsoft dropped Windows as an operating system entirely,
confusingly bringing out a not-at-all-secure browser under the same name, and
hoping nobody would notice. So that was Windows stuffed: I couldn't use that
as an online system anymore. Needing a quick replacement, I was stuck with my
printer interface. (I also have a proper computer; but I'm not putting that
online.)
<P>So, unexpectedly not being able to use my pre-existing Linux box for logic
design work, I tried applying for a grant for a laptop, and that went
precisely nowhere, despite initial promises to the contrary.
<P>So I thought to myself, &quot;How can I engineer my way around this?&quot;
<UL>
<LI>The answer was to make my own FPGA &amp; toolchain.
<LI>And also, I had this idea for an FPGA.
<LI>And also, I was rather frustrated with all the stuff traditional FPGAs
simply can't do.

<P>Blog mode engaged:
<BR>&quot;We are the Blog... Lower your expectations and surrender your free
time. We will add your schedule and calendar punctuality to our own. Your
evening will adapt to service us. Prepare to be assimilated by far too much
reading...&quot;

<P>I really needed to talk to other people in the field about this, and get
some advice and/or alternatives. So I searched for a hardware meetup, found
nothing, searched for an open-source meetup, found nothing, searched for a
networking event for meetup founders, which was IO Academy's monthly Tech
Talent Breakfast, which was in Bath then, on Tuesday 25th April 2023. And
they fed me too. They suggested, among other things, looking for a general
coding meetup in Bristol, and CodeHub seemed to fit the bill. The next one of
those was about a week later on Wednesday 3rd May.

<P>Codehub were very helpful: They let me participate in the spontaneous
general coding discussion they do - a kind of unstructured structure... hard
to describe, but it works well. They also hunted around for hardware meetups
and contacts. An hour or two later, they told me there are not only no
hardware meetups in Bristol; there aren't any in the whole of the UK. Which
means I have to start one, doesn't it? Several people have said they'd also
like there to be one, and that they'll come to one if someone starts one.

<P>Codehub was also the second meetup where I came with questions, and
ended-up mainly answering questions: That happened at the Tech Talent
Breakfast too. I needed to know the costs &amp; prerequisites for setting up
a meetup, and I know just the people for that: php-sw. (And continuing to
work my way through the list of online resources, Codehub gave me. That led
to setting up a GitHub account, and a lot of reading.)

<P>So the next php-sw meeting was another week later, on Wednesday 10th May.
<BR>That one was a bit strange, as the venue's security didn't turn up, which
meant public access was locked, so they all had to use the staff access. As
well as that, I missed my train because I was [ironically] so busy getting
myself organised. The upshot of all that was, I ended up walking with them to
the after-meeting, in Small Bar, and while their evening's speaker explained
to me what that month's talk had been about.

<P>In Small Bar, more answering of questions, and then they gave me a
breakdown of a typical meetup's monthly costs, which weren't nearly as bad as
I was fearing, and it's possibly I could run the first month or two on a
budget of nothing. This was handy, as nobody was precisely what I happened to
have in the kitty, at that point.

<P>Then the MD of a moderately large local company messaged me out of the
blue, and offered me a job. Bonkers. Maybe that'll work. I don't know - if
not, then another month of LinkedIn Premium, and more networking with
recruitment consultants, and a frenzy of LinkedIn &quot;Easy&nbsp;Apply&quot;
hammerings.

<P>I'll get my meetup plan and networking sorted out over the next two weeks,
and then we'll see what happens.

<P>As well as all that, a hackspace-without premises appears to have started
where I live; and I look after a dormant hackspace and its mothballed premises,
so I do have some previous experience which I can bring to bear; and maybe
the new local hackspace can help.

<P>(And then a week disappears in setting up some GitHub repositories.)

<P>I also hit several new bottlenecks, but I think I've got those licked now...
